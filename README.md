# Auction Program

## Description

This project is an auction program designed to facilitate online auctions. The program allows auctioneers to list items and customers to bid on items. 
The auctioneers decide when an auction is complete. The program is implemented using proper object-oriented programming principles, including objects/classes, encapsulation, and inheritance. 
Usernames, passwords, and auctions are preserved between sessions, while other data is not retained.
